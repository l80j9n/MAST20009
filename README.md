MAST20009 Vector Calculus 
Semester 2   2024 
Assignment 1 
1.   This assignment is worth 5% of your ﬁnal MAST20009 mark.
2.   Assignments   must   be   neatly   handwritten   in   blue   or   black   pen   on   A4   paper   or   may   be   typeset   using   LATEX. Diagrams   can   be   drawn   in   pencil.
3.   You   agree to the plagiarism declaration   on   the   LMS   by   submitting   your   assign-   ment.
4.   Full working must be shown in your   solutions.
5.   Marks will be deducted for incomplete working, insu伍cient justiﬁcation of steps,   incorrect mathematical notation and for messy presentation of solutions.
6.      (a)   If   you printout   the assignment   template, write   your solutions into   the answer   spaces and then scan your assignment to a PDF ﬁle using a scanning app on   your mobile phone for   upload;
(b)   If you are unable to answer the whole question in the answer space provided   then you can append additional pages to the end of your   assignment.   If you   do this you MUST make a note in the correct answer space for the question,   warning the marker that you have appended additional   work at   the   end;
(c)   You   may   handwrite/type   your   answers   on   blank   paper   and   then   scan   for   submission; in   this case   the   ﬁrst   page   must contain   only   your student   number,   subject code and subject name.  代 写MAST20009 Vector Calculus Semester 2 2024 Assignment 1Matlab

(d)   Allow enough time to submit the PDF to Gradescope.
1.   Show that

does not   exist.
2.   Consider the function

(a)   Determine whether or not f   (x,   y) is continuous at   (0,   0).   Justify your answer.
(b)   Determine whether  exisits at (0,   0).   If   yes, evaluate  (0,   0).   If not, explain why.
(c)   Determine   where   f   (x,   y) is   C1   .   Justify   your   answer.
3.   Let   f   : R2    → R2      be   the   function
f   (x,   y) = (xsin   y   +   x,   ex2y). 
(a)   Find Df   , the   derivative   matrix   of   f. 
(b)   Let   g(x,   y)   be   a   diferentiable   function   such   that   g(-1, 1)   =   (-1,   0)   and   such that   f   (g(x,   y)) = (x,   y) for   all   (x,   y) close   to   the   point   (-1, 1).   Find Dg(-1, 1).
4.   Consider the function
f(x,   y)   =   ex+y2.
(a)   Determine   the second   order Taylor   polynomial   p2   (x,   y)   for f near   the   point (0,   0).
(b)   Approximate   f   (-0.1,   0.1) using   the ﬁrst   order   Taylor   polynomial   p1   (x,   y) for   f near the point   (0,   0). 
(c)   Using   Taylor’s   remainder   formula,   ﬁnd   an   upper   bound   for   the   error   in   your   approximation   of   f   (-0.1;   0.1) in   part   (b).
